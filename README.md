It contains data on direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.  
It contains 45,211 examples and 17 features  (16 features and 1 binary response).  

## Analysis process
1. Exploratory Analysis of Features  
2. Transforming the data
3. ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, GBT Classifier, Random Forest  
4. Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  

## Results
The best results on all metrics were achieved by the random forest, followed by logistic regression. SVM demonstrated the least accurate performance.
